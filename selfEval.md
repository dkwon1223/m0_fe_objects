# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    - These challenges were very interesting and entertaining to try and learn on my own. It was very cool to see how objects can take complex data and organize it to a higher level than an array.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - My workflow is going well so far; I just hope to stay consistent and most importantly, finish strong as well. I have been trying to implement the pomodoro learning technique to stay focused and productive while also taking breaks.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    - I learned that object literals are an excellent new data type addition to my "beginner Turing student developer" toolbox. I hope to remember how to create and access parts of objects along with all other data types learned so far in the curriculum so that I can build a strong foundation in JavaScript and programming.
